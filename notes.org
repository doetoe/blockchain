* The emphasis is on readability and simplicity, not on performance or other optimizations. For example

- When another miner generated a longer chain than you have, the full blockchain is downloaded from it, verified and then replaces the local one, rather than only downloading the required blocks, which would add the problem that the blockchain may get updated (even replaced) on the remote miner, etc.

- all unprocessed transactions are served rather than just some number

* To be done
- user/wallet/addresses etc - not important, skip
- balance: allow incomplete address
- blocks of transactions

* Robustness
- nodes and mempool
